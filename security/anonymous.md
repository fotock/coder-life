## Communicating

Forget Gmail, Skype and Facebook Messenger. These centralized, non-encrypted communication tools owned by the Internet giants are not your friends. They exist for a single reason: to collect as much data on you as possible. Meet your new friends:

### Email

- Tutanota — End-to-End encrypted email provider out of Germany
- Protonmail — End-to-End encrypted email provider out of Switzerland
- Lavabit — Snowden’s infamous email provider.

### Voice + Video Calling

- TOX — Open source encrypted video, audio, and chat software
- Jitsi — Open source encrypted video chat

### Mobile Messaging and Calling

Signal — Encrypted instant messaging and voice calling application

Keep in mind your Signal “account” is tied to your phone number, and metadata is not encrypted. Your communications are private, but not anonymous. If you wish to remain anonymous, this should only be done on a disposable phone.
